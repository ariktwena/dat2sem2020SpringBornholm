Scrum med taiga:

1. The SCRUM team
2. The roles
   1.  Product Owner
   2. Scrum Master
   3. Team member
3. The process
   1. Identifying Requirements
   2. Making User stories
      1. Story points estimate (Taiga does it based on roles - default roles can be changed: [Add new role and enable points on it](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/taigaio/gMEnbZLZt1Y) )
      2. Priority (decided by product owner) (in taiga.io its applied by the order of U.S. in the Backlog)
   3. Product Backlog
   4. Define sprints
   5. First sprint: Sprint planning meeting: based on U.S. points move U.S with highest priority into sprint (as many as possible based on Story points).
   6. Sprint stories -> break down to tasks and allocate (Scrum master and member together)
   7. Daily scrum meeting.
      1. 15 min stående møde.
      2. Status på hver enkelt task - flyt dem mellem stadierne.
      3. Tildel nye tasks og afklar risici (mulige forhold der forsinker).
   8. Sprint retrospective: (team-building and evolving)
      1. Hvad gik godt i sprintet
      2. Hvad gik skidt i sprintet
      3. Hvad kan vi gøre fremadrettet for at blive bedre?
   9. Sprint review (with product owner)
      1. How far are we now in the project?
   10. Technical review (Optional)
       1. In our case this is when code and design ideas are discussed with teachers.
       2. In industry this might be a scrum team inviting a senior developer/ technical specialist to a demonstration of ideas and feasibilities. 
4. [Custom fields on stories, tasks and issues](https://tree.taiga.io/support/admin/custom-fields/#2.-using-custom-fields)
5. [Github integration](https://tree.taiga.io/support/integrations/github-integration/)

## Create user story

An Epic (story) is a user story so big and complex that its hard to define and often will break down to several  U.S. It can serve well as a team container for ideas before they are assigned to a particular team or roles (Design, UX or other)

1. Name
2. Description
3. Tag
4. Points (UX, Design, Front, Back) - Story points
5. Attachment
6. Team/Client requirement
   1. Only added if this story is an extra story introduced midt sprint
   2. Team: The story is for the sake of the team (Not ordered by the client: e.g. Refactoring, change db etc.).
7. Status (New, ready, in-progress, ready-for-test, done, archived ... user defined ones as well)
